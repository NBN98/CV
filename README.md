- ImageReader in Branch V1 done (think so). Please try it out. Maybe there are some issues regarding loading and creating the left/right tensor
- I Used cat for image concatenation to get 600x800x(N+1)*3 (maybe there is another way)
- I Used a lot of loops for everything. Maybe you guys will find a way better method for loading the images and creating the tensor
